# MITgcm_perturb

This contains scripts used for plotting output from perturbation experiments within an Amundsen Sea configuration of the ice-ocean model MITgcm.

Scripts are those used for the research paper "Wind-driven coastal polynya variability drives decadal ice-shelf melt variability in the Amundsen Sea" by Michael Haigh, Paul R. Holland and Thomas Caton Harrison.
